Hello guys Today I Namit Bajaj is going to tell you  about my gaming experiance. So lets start.

I played many games from my childhood in my mobile and laptop, mostly in mobile.<br> But I always played them for my timepass and enjoyment.<br> But my actual gaming 
started from lockdown 2020 june. When I started to watch gaming youtubers. From that time My interest in gaming incresed and I wished to become a professional gamer
<br>But as you all know that in our Indian society gaming is just reffered as timewaste or timepass<br> No One tries to understand that gaming can be profession too. <br> 
From june 2020 till today I am trying to make this society understand them importance of gaming and will try in future too. Bye:-)
